# GitHub-followers
Simple (storyBoard free) iOS app which lists your Github followers. 
This app uses Sean Allen's take-home project, as starting point. 
But it diverges from Sean implementation in various ways. 


Under Development: 
this is just an iOS app, which makes use of Github API. 

Some of the goals of this projects are: 
- to develop the visual interface of the app in code only, without using Interface Builder.
- to practice Unit testing & documentation
- to use the final version of the project as playground for trying different design patterns
